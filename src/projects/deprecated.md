These are projects I have worked on or completed that have been out-dated or
abandoned.

- **[Equipment Status Viewer](http://sukima.github.com/redmine_equipment_status_viewer)** -
  A [redmine][] plugin that tracks equipment and there last know location.
  Entry of the last know location will be done via an iPhone web interface and
  use qr-codes to "check-in" equipment. (This project is in search of
  collaboration. I no longer maintain it.)
- **[xmledit](http://github.com/sukima/xmledit)** - A filetype plugin for [VIM][]
  to help edit XML files. (I deprecated this for [ZenCodeing][zen] but still
  maintain it for bugs).
