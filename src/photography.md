I am a bit of photography buff. I am an enthhusiest of panoramas. Especially
the Virtual Tours on you find on [360cities](http://360cities.net/).

A lot of my knowlwdge came from the following tutorials:

* [How To Get Started on 360Â° Panoramic Photography - 360cities.net](http://help.360cities.net/taking-panoramic-pictures/how-to-get-started)
* [Panorama Tutorial Series by FloTube and elfloz](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL15B8C737F69319BE)

## What I use ##

My camera equipment consists of the [Canon EOS Rebel XS][1] with a [Bower 8mm
Fisheye][2] lens (known with many other names like Samyang). I also use a
Panoramic Tripod Head called [the Panosaurus][panosaurus] to minimizing the
paralax errors.

After this is done I use a lot of tools. The most promenent tools are:

* [Hugin][hugin] - A panorama sticher.
* [GIMP][gimp] - An image editor.

After I developed a finish product I will deploy it by converting it to several
formats. The following are tools I use in the background but are not needed for
making a panoramia.

* [PanoTools](http://panotools.sourceforge.net/) - Command line tools to convert panos
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) - Command line tool to convert images
* [SaladoConverter][salado] - Java GUI application to convert panos to DeepZoom format
* [SaladoPlayer][salado] - Flash panoramic viewer
* [vr5](http://www.vrhabitat.com/#vr5) - Panoramic viewer for iPhones, iPods, and iPads
