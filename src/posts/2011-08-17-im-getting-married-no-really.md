So as an update on what I've been doing (considering I haven't posted in a long
time). I've been pretty occupied. I planning a wedding and a buying a house all in the same month!

WTF I say I'm a _mad man_! Yup I am crazy. But that is where my time has been sucked into.

I am still updating [SimNotify][1] but recently I created the [wedding
site][2]. It will hold all the updates about the wedding and the house. If you
interested in me check it out. BTW The site was created in Jekyll just like
this one and I'm a little proud of it. Unlike this site I made it compatible
with iPhones using CSS and JavaScript. The site content is very geeky and
quirky. I put in a lot of references to geek culture. Thought it was fun to
mention.

Oh and I have also added Atom feed support to this blog.
