Maddy and I went to Washing DC this fall. There is so much to see there that
we descided to go every year and hit a different national park or museum. *Hehe*

Anyway wanted to share some photos from the trip. And to start off with another
fantastic **Panoramic** taken at the Navy Memorial across from the National
Archives. *(See if you can find waldo)*

## And for some highlights of the trip

I know someone who will really appreciate the video games we saw at
[The Art of Video Games](http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/The-Art-of-Video-Games-840)
exhibit.

The rocks are all exhibits in the Natural Arts Museum in the Gems section. We did see
[The Hope Diamond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Diamond).
However, There was no easy way to get a good picture of it. (people were
gawking pretty badly *rolls eyes*).
