I have been doing a lot of study into [CoffeeScript][] and found the ease of
class definitions fantastic. But As most of my code used [static classes][1]
(methods) I had a bit of trouble figuring out howe it is done in CoffeScript.

I found [this article][2] in the docs that explained most of it. And so I
developed an example:

{{jsbin "goseri/1" "js"}}
