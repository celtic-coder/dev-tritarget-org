I did a lot of reading last night. Enough to convince me to switch my
versioning software from Subversion to Git. I will be moving my sources there
soon. As this domain will also be moving. More later.

[Check out Git](http://git-scm.com/)

**UPDATE:** The switch has been made. I will be moving the old Subversion
repositories over soon.
