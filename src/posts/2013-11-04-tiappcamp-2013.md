Had the wonderful opportunity to attend [TiAppCamp](http://tiappcamp.org/) 2013
in Atlanta, GA. I had a wonderful time and learned a lot about the platform I
use at work to make really cool things happen on mobile phones. While there I
had time to take some interesting pictures.

The hotel I stayed at was The Hotel Indigo which is right next to The Fox
Theatre. The theme was all the tickets from people who were fans of The Fox
Theatre. The from lobby was quite impressive and I tried my best to capture it
in this panorama:

I had a little fun with some shots outside. The "Ghosts at the theatre" image
was a tone mapped HDR (High Dynamic Range) Photo constructed my layering
multiple shots with different exposures on top of each other:
