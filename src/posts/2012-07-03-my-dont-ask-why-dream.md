So I had this dream (well kind of hypothetical nightmare) and I felt it was
interesting because it centered around the idea of complacency, questioning the
status quo, and how that stifles a team environment. 

A company I used to work for had moved from Boston to Connecticut allowing me
to work for them again. (it was surprising that this company was the focus of
the dream as this  company had shown poor business practices during the dot com
bubble which is why i was laid off so many years ago). It was a software
company and I was a software developer. Anyway they held a company wide meeting
to deliberate a merger with a larger company. This upset a great number of
people and as always the most vocal of the bunch was standing and poo-poo-ing
everything causing the meeting to grind to a halt.

At which point I spoke up. I can not remember what the conversation was about
but I do distinctively remember asking **why**. This immediately spawned a
angry reaction for the vocal guy why quickly retaliated. Immediately the
meeting was halted while the executives (read HR) attempted to regain control
by deliberating with the man. This whole meeting was very union-esc.

After a brief  distraction from a tornado the meeting was about to reassemble
and just before one of the HR ladies pulled me aside and asked me if I could
attend a Wednesday remediation session with her.

The dream leaves with me preparing to find a new job since I had just become
the boat rocker. I was being remediated for asking *why*. The dream continued
to rattle around as I was awake brewing my morning coffee. With my daydreaming
I developed a dialog with the HR lady and attempted to reason with her that
remediation was the opposite of what a software development company wants.

The fact of the matter is {" when the very act of questioning the status quo
punishes the asker then the system is doomed to fail. "} Google and Apple just
to name a few would never have gotten to where they were without asking *why*
from time to time. Challenging the preconceived notions and bucking some
authority.

This is significant. We *need* free thinkers. Individuality is a must to
continue the human race. And I know that free thinking is the direct enemy to
complacency. And *that* is significant because complacency is how those in
power stay in power.

You can't defend against a regime if you are content with your wicked flat
screen you purchased on invisible credit in a WallyWorld at a *way low price*!
I know I wouldn't be interested in pitchforks and torches if I was laying back
watching another episode of a reality TV show.

The simpler point is inside corporations. It is too easy to just let your
employees just do. Without fostering that spark of inspiration or that seed of
free thinking you can't expect high intensity productivity from the employees.
{" People want to be more then themselves. "} They want to experience ownership
in their work. They want to be proud of what they do. And stiffiling that seed
makes people go to work for the sake of money. And productivity and innovation
go out the window to the companies' closest competetors.

As a friend of mine once said **"A happy employee is a productive employee."**
