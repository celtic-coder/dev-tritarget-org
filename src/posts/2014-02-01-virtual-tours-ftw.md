I had the most amazing time visiting some friends in North Carolina's Blue Ridge
Mountains. The area is very beautiful and I highly recommend anyone looking for a
quiet and relaxing vacation to take a look at
[renting a cabin](http://cabin-nc.com/) and seeing this area for yourself.

Here are a few pictures I took in Burnsville, NC:

cattail/SuspendedRock.jpg: A rock sculpture in the Blue Ridge Mountains
cattail/SuspendedRockBW.jpg: The same rock sculpture with a little B&W flare

I also got to practise my Panoramic skills by creating my first virtual tour of
a House that, in my humble opinion, is one of the most beautiful houses I've
seen. (Permission granted by owners to use these on my blog).

Click on anyone of the following to start the virtual tour. If your on an iPhone
or iPad then you will have to click each one manually and the quality is not as
good so I recommend you view these on your desktop.
