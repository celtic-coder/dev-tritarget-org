For the longest time I couldn't ever find any information on having a private
blog. My problem was I wanted a homepage accessible to all and yet allow family
members to contribute having their entries hidden from the public eye. Although
I could never decide if it should be blocked by catagory (role
based/authorization) or blocked globally (authentication).

I found the following solutions for Wordpress from a
[forum entry](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/100054?replies=6).

Role based: [Category Access](http://www.coppit.org/code/) (scroll to bottom)

Authentication: [Private WP](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/private-wp/)
and better Authentication:
[Members Only](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members-only/)

Or using an outside (read site-wide) solution:
[HTTP Authentication](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/http-authentication/)
([htaccess admin](http://webscripts.softpedia.com/script/Snippets/Htaccess-User-Management-and-Authentication-System-10102.html))
