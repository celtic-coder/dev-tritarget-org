Not every High school graduation speech is all that enlightening. I remember
mine. I was thinking gee this is a long speech. Same ol' blah blah... You made
it, Yeah... Go into the world and do something... blah blah. I didn't pay
attention much. Than again, I don't think I would have paid much attention even
if it was something exceptional. I was young and naive. The idea of
constructing my dreams and life hacking was so foreign to me. Like most grads
that kind of meta cognition wasn't a skill I learned until much later in life.

That is why I really enjoyed what this [High school teacher spoke][1] about to
the Wellesley class of 2012:

> Here we are on a literal level playing field.  That matters.  That says
> something.  And your ceremonial costume... shapeless, uniform,
> one-size-fits-all.  Whether male or female, tall or short, scholar or
> slacker, spray-tanned prom queen or intergalactic X-Box assassin, each of you
> is dressed, you'll notice, exactly the same.  And your diploma... but for
> your name, exactly the same. All of this is as it should be, because none of
> you is special.

I think we often times forget how alike we are. We focus on how we are
different and not how we are the same. It isn't until you _level the playing
field_ that you notice how you can rise above, excel, be more then the status
quo. That takes work.

> The fulfilling life, the distinctive life, the relevant life, is an
> achievement, not something that will fall into your lap because you're a nice
> person or mommy ordered it from the caterer.  You'll note the founding
> fathers took pains to secure your inalienable right to life, liberty and the
> pursuit of happiness–quite an active verb, "pursuit"–which leaves, I should
> think, little time for lying around watching parrots rollerskate on Youtube.

He further expands on the concept that the journy is the goal not the other way
around:

> None of this day-seizing [You-Live-Only-Once philosophy] should be
> interpreted as license for self-indulgence.  Like accolades ought to be, the
> fulfilled life is a consequence, a gratifying byproduct.  It's what happens
> when you’re thinking about more important things.  Climb the mountain not to
> plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the
> view.  Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you.

I just wanted to share such a positive and worthwhile speech. Read the whole
speech at [The Swellesley Report][1].
