## Background

I am a highly passionate software developer and fast learner, with interests in mobile and web technologies, security, leadership, teamwork, and teaching. I have a child like sense of wonder to programming and enjoy discovering new ideas.

I strive for quality. I believe the code I write should have a degree of prose akin to the kind of user experiences I expect end users to have. I feel fellow developers and my future self are as much an *end user* as anyone else.

In my free time I enjoy contributing to open source projects, and exploring photography.
