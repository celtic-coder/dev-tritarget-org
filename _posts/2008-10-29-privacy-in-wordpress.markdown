For the longest time I couldn't ever find any information on having a private blog. My problem was I wanted a homepage accessible to all and yet allow family members to contribute having their entries hidden from the public eye. Although I could never decide if it should be blocked by catagory (role based/authorization) or blocked globally (authentication).

I found the following solutions for Wordpress from a <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/100054?replies=6">forum entry</a>.

Role based: <a href="http://www.coppit.org/code/">Category Access</a> (scroll to bottom)

Authentication: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/private-wp/">Private WP</a> and better Authentication: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members-only/">Members Only</a>

Or using an outside (read site-wide) solution: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/http-authentication/">HTTP Authentication</a> (<a href="http://webscripts.softpedia.com/script/Snippets/Htaccess-User-Management-and-Authentication-System-10102.html">htaccess admin</a>)
