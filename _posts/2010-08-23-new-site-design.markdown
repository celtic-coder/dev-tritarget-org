How do you like the new site design?

Not much to say since this is a visual thing but the menu to the left is
collapsible. (I love jQuery)

Oh I should mention I developed a JavaScript port of the clasic [ski game][1]
and it is an easter egg here using the [konami code][2]. try it out and have
fun. And check out the code if you want to play with it at
[skiQuery GitHub page][3].
