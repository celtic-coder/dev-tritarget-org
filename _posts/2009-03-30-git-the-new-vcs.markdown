I did a lot of reading last night. Enough to convince me to switch my versioning software from Subversion to Git. I will be moving my sources there soon. As this domain will also be moving. More later.

<a href="http://git-scm.com/">Check out Git</a>

<b>UPDATE:</b> The switch has been made. I will be moving the old Subversion repositories over soon.
