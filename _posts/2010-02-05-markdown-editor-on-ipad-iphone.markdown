Is it possible to have a [markdown][] editor on an [iPad][] or [iPhone][]?

This idea came to me on the basis that there are times when a full laptop is
overkill for a quick blog entry and yet my blogs are done in [Jekyll][] which
is _text_ based not _word processor_ based. Jekyll is starting to become more
popular with geeks. But you can only edit on a computer. Brushing aside the
question if blogging _should_ be done on an iPhone and adding the concept of
an appliance with the iPad the need to have a _geek_ text editor (as opposed
to Apple's Pages) will become more apparent.

So lets look at the idea of a programmer inspired text editor on the iPhone
OS. Some of the key ideas needed in a successful editor could be:

* Syntax Highlighting
* Easy cursor movement
* Long line support
* Ability to gain context of the text without sacrificing the readability
* simplified text manipulation functions
* file management (FTP, SSH, Git, Etc.)

I'm a big [VIM][] fan but the idea of having many _modes_ would be ridicules
on a touch device. Not to mention having keyboard shortcuts would be a
nightmare on a touch device. One idea would be to use gestures. But that's a
lot of memorization and defeats the ease of use motto.

I had the thought of using the rotate gesture just like [VoiceOver][]. One
could rotate their fingers to change the _modes_. Also one could use a finger
touch with slide to quickly move the cursor from column one to the last
column.

I'll keep playing with interface ideas. I think there is some way git Jekyll
based blogs updated via an iPhone / iPad.

On a final note I think integrating Git would be awesome but is that overkill?

Please any ideas comments?
