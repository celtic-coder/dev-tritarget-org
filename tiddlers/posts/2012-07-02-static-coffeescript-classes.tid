But As most of my code used [[static classes|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_method#Static_methods]] (methods) I had a bit of trouble figuring out howe it is done in ~CoffeScript.

I found [[this article|http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/03_classes.html]] in the docs that explained most of it. And so I developed an example:
