I am a bit of photography buff. I am an enthusiast of panoramas. Especially the Virtual Tours you find on [[360cities|http://360cities.net/]].

A lot of my knowledge came from the following tutorials:

* [[How To Get Started on 360Â° Panoramic Photography - 360cities.net|http://help.360cities.net/taking-panoramic-pictures/how-to-get-started]]
* [[Panorama Tutorial Series by FloTube and elfloz|http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL15B8C737F69319BE]]

!! What I use

My camera equipment consists of the [[Canon EOS Rebel XS]] with a [[Bower 8mm Fisheye]] lens (known with many other names like Samyang). I also use a Panoramic Tripod Head called [[Panosaurus]] to minimizing the parallax errors.

After this is done I use a lot of tools. The most prominent tools are:

* [[Hugin]] - A panorama stitcher.
* [[GIMP]] - An image editor.

After I developed a finish product I will deploy it by converting it to several
formats. The following are tools I use in the background but are not needed for
making a panorama.

* [[Panotools]] - Command line tools to convert panoramas
* [[GrapicsMagick]] - Command line tool to convert images
* [[Pannellum]] - An HTML5/~WebGL Panorama viewer

I develop these on either a Linux machine running Ubuntu or a Mac with Mac OS X.
