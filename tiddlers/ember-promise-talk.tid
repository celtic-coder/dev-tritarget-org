An example demo on having fun with EmberJSâ€¦ promise.

It is a fully working (graphical) slot machine written in the EmberJS framework.

This is the result of wanting a working ember application to use during a talk about [[Promises]]. It is in progress but the game portion is working. Try it out!.
