title: Seek out the little things

I am grateful for //the little things// that remind me that someone cares about me. For example my wife made me a lunch and unbeknownst to me left a little note in there //just because//.

I look at how the every day grind can really distract you from realizing that life itself is amazing. And it is sad at times to know just how hard humans work at ignoring that fact.

Take a moment each day and look at something that is completely benign and contemplate just how much went into it. You might be surprise to find out that the flower has a pleasant smell. (That was a reference to the clich√© //stop and smell the flowers//).
