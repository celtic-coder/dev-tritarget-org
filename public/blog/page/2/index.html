  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I found this really cool trick. A way to use Git branches to store complete
new repositories inside another. What I mean is basically hiding a side
project in a Git branch. This is great for things like unmodified images, HTML
source for a project page attached to the project itself, documentation,
storing large files that are not needed with every clone of the master branch,
storing approved copies of libraries and other dependencies.</p>

<p>I use this feature to store meta data on a project for example many of my
website projects have the actual web files but the design was first created
using comps (usually blank markups and/or Photoshop files). Once I use these
comps to make the site they are usually no longer needed. However later down
the road when I need to reference them because the client wished for a change
I find them deleted. I though about storing them out on the server but then
there is two locations I have to remember instead of the source repository.</p>

<p>In the SVN days I used to add a forth directory:</p>

<pre><code>Root
|+Tags
|+Branches
|+Trunk
`+Comps
</code></pre>

<p>There were the usual directories and another for the comps. Working on the
source you would checkout the Trunk directory and never see Comps unless you
checked it out manually.</p>

<p>Git also allows this only much easier and cleaner. And Github has a great how to
with there <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> section and also from this <a href="http://madduck.net/blog/2007.07.11:creating-a-git-branch-without-ancestry/">blog post</a>.
However I&#8217;ll repost the instructions here.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you have no local or un-committed changes or they will be lost!</strong></p>

<p>First create a new symbolic reference to a new branch. We don&#8217;t make a new
branch in the normal way because it will link itself to the current HEAD and
what we want it to link it to nothing. That way any files on the new branch
are unassociated to any branches you make with your code.</p>

<pre><code>$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/head/newbranch
</code></pre>

<p>This will create the new branch <em>and</em> put you in that branch. Next is a bit
strange. Since the <em>index</em> that Git knows about still has all the files in
the master branch and so doing a <code>git status</code> will show all those files ready
to be committed. This isn&#8217;t what we want we need to clear out the index.
Easiest way is to delete the index file since Git will recreate it if missing.
It will recreate it properly based on the branch we are in.</p>

<pre><code>$ rm .git/index
</code></pre>

<p>Last but not least all those files are still in the working directory. It&#8217;s a
pain to go through and <code>rm -rf</code> everything (And dangerous) make Git do it with
a clean.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clean -fdx
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE: This branch now needs to manually be attached</strong></p>

<p>Turns out (maybe a version thing) that I was unable to use the new branch
created before because git claimed it was detached. After I had commited
something (important or git thinks the branch hasn&#8217;t been born yet) I had to
explicitly check out the new branch for it to work:
<code>git checkout -b newbranch</code></p>

<p>Now Your ready. Add some files, Commit them and eventually push them.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin newbranch
</code></pre>

<p>What&#8217;s great is a clone by anyone will get the master branch and ignore this
new branch unless they need it and they pull it manually.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: full walk through</strong></p>

<pre><code>(no branch)$ git init test_repo
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/suki/tmp/test_repo/.git/
(no branch)$ cd test_repo/
(master)$ echo "test data in master" &gt; testdata-in-master

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is it possible to have a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a> editor on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>?</p>

<p>This idea came to me on the basis that there are times when a full laptop is
overkill for a quick blog entry and yet my blogs are done in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which
is <em>text</em> based not <em>word processor</em> based. Jekyll is starting to become more
popular with geeks. But you can only edit on a computer. Brushing aside the
question if blogging <em>should</em> be done on an iPhone and adding the concept of
an appliance with the iPad the need to have a <em>geek</em> text editor (as opposed
to Apple&#8217;s Pages) will become more apparent.</p>

<p>So lets look at the idea of a programmer inspired text editor on the iPhone
OS. Some of the key ideas needed in a successful editor could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax Highlighting</li>
<li>Easy cursor movement</li>
<li>Long line support</li>
<li>Ability to gain context of the text without sacrificing the readability</li>
<li>simplified text manipulation functions</li>
<li>file management (FTP, SSH, Git, Etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m a big <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> fan but the idea of having many <em>modes</em> would be ridicules
on a touch device. Not to mention having keyboard shortcuts would be a
nightmare on a touch device. One idea would be to use gestures. But that&#8217;s a
lot of memorization and defeats the ease of use motto.</p>

<p>I had the thought of using the rotate gesture just like <a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision.html">VoiceOver</a>. One
could rotate their fingers to change the <em>modes</em>. Also one could use a finger
touch with slide to quickly move the cursor from column one to the last
column.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll keep playing with interface ideas. I think there is some way git Jekyll
based blogs updated via an iPhone / iPad.</p>

<p>On a final note I think integrating Git would be awesome but is that overkill?</p>

<p>Please any ideas comments?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I took the learning exercise on getting <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> working on
<a href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> mainly because I have a <a href="http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way">gitosis</a> environment set up for my
personal projects. I had plans to write down the process I used to accomplish
this. However, after it was all completed I found a <a href="http://tatey.com/2009/04/29/jekyll-meets-dreamhost-automated-deployment-for-jekyll-with-git/">blog post</a> that
detailed exactly the process I haphazardly stumbled onto.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the author mentions that this method of deployment is
not ideal. And that a <a href="http://tatey.com/2009/10/29/simpler-deployment-for-jekyll-using-a-rakefile-and-rsync/">better solution</a> is available to most users.</p>

<p>I do like the Rakefile and rsync solution as it is quite elegant however for
my site which is under gitosis it isn&#8217;t usable. Gitosis blocks shell access
via SSH for the Git repo user in order to facilitate authentication. And
because the website is owned by the Git repo user rsync will never reach the
file system to sync. So in my case I have to use Git hooks and compile the
site on the server with Jekyll.</p>

<p>I have decided to allow the use of <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> by using a <a href="http://tatey.com/2009/12/05/forking-jekyll-now-with-less-and-growl-notifications/">fork of Jekyll by
tatey</a> even if I don&#8217;t intend to use LESS soon at least I have it and this
fork has <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> notifications (<a href="http://gemcutter.org/gems/growl">gem</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think a lot of confusion comes from the idea of pointers and release
responsibility. I find it is best to think of pointers as tether
lines. Like in space the astronauts need to be very careful to
maintain their tether lines or else the astronaut will float way and
die a horrible death. Pointers are very much like that. The object you
alloc/init is your astronaut and the variable (pointer) you assign it
to is your first tether line. Now when you retain the object it
created another tether line.</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='objc'>// obj is now tethered to a spot on the space shuttle. 
NSObject *obj = [[NSObject alloc] init];
 
// Another tether line has just been tied to the SAME
// EXACT HOOK on the shuttle craft. 
[obj retain]; 

// You just removed one of the tethers. Since there is
// another one still attached you don't attempt to
// being the astronaut back inside. 
[obj release]; 

// You just sawed off the one hook you had and the
// astronaut and the last tether line is floating far
// away to die a horrible death. 
obj = nil; 

// A new astronaut has been attached to tether line
// attached to the shuttle craft. You have also just
// told the maintenance droid that when it is done
// swabbing the deck to cut only the tether line you
// just made. If that's the last line get the astronaut
// inside if not let the astronaut float some more with
// the other tether lines. 
obj = [[[NSObject alloc] init] autorelease]; 

// You have just attached another tether line to the
// astronaut however this time the new tether line is
// not attached to the same hook but to another
// astronaut floating around. 
NSMutableArray *array = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; 
[array addObject:obj]; 

// The maintenance droid has finished it's tasks (run
// loop complete pool is released) so it cuts the
// designated tether line. However there was another
// line that array attached to in its addObject: method
// so the astronaut doesn't float away. In other words
// array is responsible for the astronaut now and the
// original code doesn't care. What this does is tell
// you were the hook that holds the tether line is
// allowing you to pull the astronaut in to talk and
// let go without him floating away. It doesn't add a
// tether or remove one it simple says &quot;here I am&quot; If
// you want to not loose where the astronaut is then
// you have to take ownership by adding another tether
// line of your own so that when array cut it's tether
// line you still have the astronaut. 
NSObject *another_object = [array objectAtIndex:1]; 
[another_object retain]; 

// Second tether line cut. array still has one.
// Astronaut safe. 
[another_object release]; 

// And finally when you cut array's tether line both
// astronauts are brought in safely. The last line
// attached to array is pulled in and removed. Just
// before array goes inside he pulls in the original
// astronaut still attached to himself. 
[array release];</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>When you alloc/init you own that object it is your responsibility to
either release it appropriately or pass on the responsibility to
another object. NSArray will take one the responsibility (addObject:)
but it will not give that responsibility back (objectAtIndex:) when it
returns the object from objectAtIndex: it is your responsibility to
either not worry about it as you don&#8217;t need the object later. or if
you do to retain it yourself so that when array goes away it doesn&#8217;t
take you object that you made yourself responsible for away under your
nose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently installed <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/">MantisBT</a> a PHP based bug tracker. I found a
<a href="http://git.mantisforge.org/">great plugin</a> that lets Mantis monitor a source repository and associate
the logs to issue and bug tickets.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have much explanation of the process I used to install it. It was your
basic PHP based system. I use gitosis to handle the Git repositories. I can
config gitosis to authorize gitweb with a cherry picked set of repositories.
However, Mantis uses gitweb to link into the git repositories. Since the
gitosis config handles gitweb publicly I didn&#8217;t want just anyone to browse the
source via gitweb. But I need a gitweb for all repositories so mantis could
track changes.</p>

<p>What I did was copy the gitweb CGI directory to another directory. I change
it&#8217;s configuration to read all repositories (Yes this includes the
gitosis-admin.git repo) and then use an apache .htaccess file to log access
except from the webserver itself (mantis PHP script).</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='apache'># filename: wwwroot/private_gitweb/.htaccess
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 127.0.0.1</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p><em>You might have to replace <code>127.0.0.1</code> with the IP of your site not loaclhost.
(Use <code>ping yoursite</code> to get the external IP)</em></p>

the system what to do.</p>

<p>We have chosen to use Java as the programming language. Mainly the choice was
because of OOP and tight Type Casting. We&#8217;ll get more into these later on. But
what we will get into now is the basics for getting the computer to talk to
us.</p>

<p>Now the computer uses what we call <em>Machine Code</em> to tell the CPU
(Computer) what to do. It is a series of one&#8217;s and zero&#8217;s that are specific to
that type of computer. When we write a program we have to translate that
program into this machine code and that is done through another program call a
compiler. Now for the monkey wrench. Java is a  bit different. Instead of
compiling it into machine code for your type of computer (PC, Mac, Etc.) it
will compile it into machine code for a <em>virtual</em> computer that doesn&#8217;t
exists. We call this special machine code <em>bytecode</em>. When you run a
compiled Java program (bytecode) your computer emulates this virtual computer
that the bytecode was meant for. We call this process the <em>Java Virtual
Machine</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/javavm.jpg" alt="Diagram of the application process" /></p>

<p>So how do we do this? First off you need the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit" title="Wikipedia entry for Java Development Kit">Java Development</a> Kit. Head
over to <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/" title="Official download of JDK">http://java.sun.com/javase/</a> and choose the <strong>JDK</strong> not the JRE to
download. (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/install/jdk/install-windows.html" title="How to install the JDK on windows">Installation instructions</a> for windows users) Mac users can
download it <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/download/" title="Java JDK Download">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once installed let&#8217;s do something simple: Our first program. Copy the following
into a file ending with the suffix <code>.java</code> for example
<code>C:\My_First_Project\hello.java</code></p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>/**
 * My First Program.
 * See the whole article at
 * http://tritarget.org/blog/2008/10/29/my-first-program/
 */
class Hello
{
    /**
     * Entry point.
     * @param args the command line parameters.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Output to the screen the following phrase.
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    }
}</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Now after you save it open up a command line (Most Windows computers will open
a command line by selecting Start | Run&#8230; and typing in <code>cmd</code> or <code>command</code>
depending on the Windows version. See <a href="http://commandwindows.com/command1.htm" title="Using the command line">commandwindows.com</a> for more info)
and get yourself to that directory. Then compile the code and run it through
the Virtual Machine. (The Java programs need to be in your PATH. If the
following does not work as expected perhaps you can take a look at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/install/jdk/install-windows.html#Environment" title="Setting up your evironment in windows">setting
your PATH</a>)</p>

<pre><code>C:&gt; CD My_First_Project
C:\My_First_Project&gt; javac hello.java
C:\My_First_Project&gt; java Hello
Hello World!
</code></pre>

<p>So lets take a look at what we did.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Line 1:</strong> We changed the directory to where we save the file. This allows
us to perform actions contained within the directory. Helps with organizing
things and simplifies how we interact with the command line.
<strong>Line 2:</strong> We compile the source code into bytecode. the <code>javac</code> command</li>
<li>will make a new file in this directory called <code>Hello.class</code> which is the
bytecode.</li>
<li><strong>Line 3:</strong> We run the bytecode through the virtual machine. The command
<code>java</code> only needs to know what <em>class</em> you want to execute (Will
explain later) suffice it to say it does not need the <code>.class</code> and it is
capitalized.</li>
<li><strong>Line 4:</strong> This what you should see if everything worked out.</li>
</ul>


<p>Congratulations you just made your first program. I know kind of anti climatic
but we&#8217;ll get better. So lets look at parts of the program.</p>

<h4>Comments</h4>

<p>I don&#8217;t care what anyone says. Comments make the code! Learn them and use them!
A comment is a piece of text in your source code that doesn&#8217;t do anything. It
is there so when you read it or when others read it they know what the heck is
going on and how to use things. You will see through out my code there are
comments describing what it&#8217;s doing or information that is useful to someone
who is developing the program.</p>

<p>A comment is created by surrounding the text in the characters &#8217;<code>/*</code>&#8217; and
&#8217;<code>*/</code>&#8217; or if the line starts with &#8217;<code>//</code>&#8217;.</p>

<h4>Wrappers</h4>

<p>Ok so without getting into too much detail all Java programs must have the
following: Class definition and an Entry Point. We will discuss this later as
to why but for now every program you make will have a line that defines the
<em>class</em>:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>class Hello</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Everything is surrounded by brackets. This give the code a look of hierarchy
again for organization. So we use these curly brackets around all the &#8220;blocks&#8221;
of code. Some people like to put the curly bracket on the same line some like
it underneath it doesn&#8217;t matter which either works just as well.</p>

<h4>Entry Point</h4>

<p>The entry point is where executing of your program starts. As we learn about
OOP you&#8217;ll understand that all programs have to start some where and they all
start with the following line (We will explain the meaning of these commands in
later modules):</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>And again we surround the next block in curly brackets.</p>

<h4>Execution</h4>

<p>Last but not least that actual  part of the code that does anything. As we
venture into OOP you understand why this command is so drawn out but for now
just deal with it looking cumbersome.</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='java'>System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>First off all <em>commands</em> end with a semi-colon. Forget one of these and it all
falls apart. Since this is our only statement we only have one. This is
different from say the above wrappers which do not need an ending semi-colon.
Now what we are asking the computer to do is ask the &#8220;System&#8221; object for the
output object and telling the output object to print a line of text. This
esentially just shows the &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; text on the screen since the output
object is associated with the command line your typing in.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now we will get much more detail later but for now you made your
first program.</p>
