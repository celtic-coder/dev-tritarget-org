  <div class="entry-content"><p>So as an update on what I&#8217;ve been doing (considering I haven&#8217;t posted in a long
time). I&#8217;ve been pretty occupied. I planning a wedding and a buying a house all in the same month!</p>

<p>WTF I say I&#8217;m a <em>mad man</em>! Yup I am crazy. But that is where my time has been sucked into.</p>

<p>I am still updating <a href="http://github.com/sukima/SimNotify">SimNotify</a> but recently I created the <a href="http://maddywillyoumarryme.com">wedding
site</a>. It will hold all the updates about the wedding and the house. If you
interested in me check it out. BTW The site was created in Jekyll just like
this one and I&#8217;m a little proud of it. Unlike this site I made it compatible
with iPhones using CSS and JavaScript. The site content is very geeky and
quirky. I put in a lot of references to geek culture. Thought it was fun to
mention.</p>

<p>Oh and I have also added Atom feed support to this blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I was tasked to run a class on how to run and use a propriatary software.
Our class room was all decked out with the latest SmartBoard technology. But
that is the only highlight of this convoluted story that will leave you
scrating your head in disbalief.</p>

<p>The computer booted up and imediatly started barking about missing network
drive <code>//FILES/.../Desktop</code> and my first thought was &#8220;Wait WTF? Network drive?
No I&#8217;m showing a powerpoint Why the fsck would I want a network drive?&#8221; This
error poped up roughly about every 2 minutes. Very anoyying. Then I was unable
to install the propiatary software as I was connected as some network
authentication and as the error box was very vocal about there was no network
(incidently how did I log on if I had no network?)</p>

<p>Anyway among this and many other issues I gave up and grabbed a laptop which
had the software on it. Opps That didn&#8217;t work. You see the wonderful folks at
HP thought it was wise to put a video card in that could not handle mirrored
displays. This was a problem because the software we use will take over a
second monitor if one exists. So it&#8217;s either the laptop display or an extended
display. Either way the students don&#8217;t get to see the presenters view on the
projector. I also found out that the laptop doesn&#8217;t allow the primary display
to be anything other then the laptop LCD! sigh.</p>

<p>So I thought hey my Mac has a virtual machine, one monitor output, and the
software installed running perfect. Only to find out I forgot the VGA adapter!
Damb it!</p>

<p>Final solotion was to hook up a ether net cable between the HP laptop and the
Mac. Run the virtual machine in full screen. Setup a temporary network between
the machines. Use VNC to view the mac screen and put the VNC viewer on the
extended desktop. Phew that was a lot! But it worked and the students could see
the software on the projector.</p>

<p>Perhaps convoluted but it worked. I&#8217;ll be contacting the IS department to
figure out why the presentation machine is bust-icated.</p>

<p>Inginuity at it&#8217;s best.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a big fan of productivity tools. I love utilities that make my life
better. &#8220;Life-hacking&#8221; is the term. I use a great tool called <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>.
However, it has some big draw backs. First off it is centralized to one file.
You can organize it by projects and areas of responsibility. Thing is this
didn&#8217;t fit well with organizing tasks to specific programming projects.</p>

<p>It seems silly to have <em>pick up the milk</em> mixed with a project for my latest
development project (<em>add newMigration() method to MainController</em>). Because of
this development todos in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> wasn&#8217;t contextually appropriate. I code on
the command line and should have my project&#8217;s todo on the command line (think:
ssh). Not only that but it was centralized and not scoped to each project.</p>

<p>(Finally <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> doesn&#8217;t have cloud syncing but bonjour syncing which is
impossible while at work! You listening <a href="http://culturedcode.com/">Cultured Code</a>? The syncing problem
makes <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> look good!)</p>

<p>So to the terminal&#8230; I found this great app called <a href="http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior/">TaskWarrior</a> which is a
very full featured task manager. It is <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">GTD</a> on the command line. Trouble is
it was centralized to one database as well. Tons of features but I still wanted
my databases based per project (directory) and optionally commit the database
to version control.</p>

<h4>Developer Todo List</h4>

<p>To the rescue is this gem called the <a href="http://swapoff.org/DevTodo">Dev Todo</a>. It is a task manager that
uses an XML file in the current directory. It&#8217;s so simple it&#8217;s stupid. However,
it is not without some great features. I use this to keep track of what I need
or want to do with a project. Basically a simple note taking. The command line
is simple and it&#8217;s quick. You have a great level of flexibility since the data
is nothing but a simple XML file which is well formatted and intuitive to
understand. But who edits data manually. The program will output, organize,
manage, and track tasks with <strong>color</strong>! It has hierarchy and it can link to
multiple other databases.</p>

<p>Here is how I&#8217;ve used it. In my Rails app I had a master <code>.todo</code> file in the
root directory of the app. I stored all the main tasks there. I also made a
todo in the <code>test</code> directory then linked them.</p>

<pre><code>$ tda -p medium add new action for :print in main_controller.rb
Index of new item is 1
$ cd test
$ tda -p medium refactor unit tests
Index of new item is 1
$ tda -p medium refactor functional tests
Index of new item is 2
$ todo --title Testing
$ cd ..
$ tdl -p high test/.todo
$ todo +
  1.Testing
      1.refactor unit tests
      2.refactor functional tests
  2.add new action :print for main_controller.rb
</code></pre>

<p>I can&#8217;t say enough cool things about this app. Perhaps I&#8217;ll write more at a
later time but it has saved me. It is now one of my must haves in development.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just have to get this out there <strong>Source Code is NOT documentation</strong></p>

<p>Far to many times I see the response to documentation to be &#8220;Look at the source
code&#8221; Or if you can&#8217;t figure it out by looking at the source code you shouldn&#8217;t
be coding. This kind of thinking is viral in the open source community.</p>

<p>I going to give an example of a project I was working on. It halted for 3
weeks because all I had was the source code to use for documentation. I was
making a Ruby on Rails app and wazs attempting to make a <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">shoulda</a> add on
that would complement the testing well.</p>

<p>The only examples were to look at the source code for shoulda so I went to
there <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">github page</a> and started reading all the source code. It became
clear that they were moving from one paradigm to another. (For those familiar
shoulda uses matchers not macros now) Well all the blog posts google could
find all talked about macros not matchers. I posted to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3915065/adding-custom-shoulda-matchers-to-testcase">stackoverflow</a>
about this and got no response. I chated in IRC several timew and still no
leads on how to crate a custom matcher other then looking at the source code
as an example.</p>

<p>Well I did that I wrote a matcher based on the source code opnly to find out
that the matchers couldn&#8217;t use common functions that a TestCase object could.
Sigh Back to macros. But wait theres more.</p>

<p>I eventually decided to figure out why adding a matcher was so convoluted
(<a href="http://gist.github.com/613522">gist with code</a>) and after several attempts and even breaking down to use
rdebug I found out that the source code that my app was using was a whole
major <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda/tree/v2.10.1">revision lower</a>! Yes the <code>gem instal shoulda</code> doesn&#8217;t equal the latest
revision. Then after code review of the correct revision it turns out that the
code does not support custom matchers.</p>

<p>The point of all this is that when it comes to using source code as your
documentation you miss a lot of the details and implementation examples
because the source code is <em>context sensitive</em> when custom macros, matchers,
etc. are based in a completely different context. This means that things will
get confusing very quickly and has a higher chance of becoming mismatched.</p>

<p>Please lets do more then just RTFC and offer beter contextual documentation.
Laziness kills a project faster then anything I know. I should talk!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am having a very difficult time trying to develop functional tests for my
recent RoR application. Some back history is that my RoR project uses
<a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">shoulda</a> and <a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">authlogic</a> and I want to test that some actions require a
user to be logged in. I ran into a quandary when I realized that shoulda has
deprecated macros in favor of matchers.</p>

<p>So. For an example If I wanted to check that a specific action would fail if
there was no use logged in I would have done this in the past:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/632707.js?file=require_logged_in_macro.rb"> </script>


<p>However this is limited in it&#8217;s use and <strong>does not</strong> conform to the direction
that shoulda has moved to (matchers) A better way to accomplish this is to
write a matcher like so:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/632707.js?file=require_logged_in.rb"> </script>


<p>This affords you the flexibility as such:</p>

<pre><code>should require_logged_in
should require_logged_in(:post)
should require_logged_in.for(:show)
should require_logged_in(:post).for(:create)
</code></pre>

<p>A little better syntax in my opinion. There are two big problems using
matchers. First they are <strong>not</strong> included by default like macros were using
the <code>shoulda_macros</code> directory. They require some code in the
<code>test_helper.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>include Shoulda::RequireLoggedIn::Matchers
extend Shoulda::RequireLoggedIn::Matchers
</code></pre>

<p>Finally you can not have access to any method that <em>TestCase</em> would have
had normally for example <code>get</code> and <code>post</code>. So this last part renders that above
match code <strong>useless</strong>.</p>

<p>Call to all shoulda developers. Please can someone tell be what you should do?
Matchers or Macros?!</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At my job we are forced to use Groupwise for our email. This isn&#8217;t going to be
a post about how much Groupwise is not agreeable but instead I&#8217;m going to
describe my solution to making my work email much more agreeable. First I&#8217;ll
describe what solutions didn&#8217;t work and why.</p>

<p>First Outlook was not a solution as my IS department couldn&#8217;t figure out how
to do that even after months of emails claiming that it was &#8220;gonna&#8221; happen. As
you can tell I have great faith in that department. Moving on&#8230;</p>

<p>I figure it was time to start using Gmail. So I setup my Groupwise rule that
forwards any new mail to a new Gmail account I created for this. (The same can
be done with outlook and exchange). I had to make sure that gmail was set to
send mails from my work email (required a verification from the settings
panel). Then I had to tell gmail to use this as the default address.</p>

<p>My company places a signature every time I send an email. Because I would be
sending from gmail that professional &#8220;this email is confidential&#8221; message at
the end of the email would not be added. So I sent my self a test email to the
gmail account from my groupwise account and copy pasted the signature to
gmail&#8217;s signature setting.</p>

<p>Now I ran into a problem when attempting to use this solution with an iPhone.
I set it up as an exchange service because that supported push (instant
notifications that a new email has arrived). The problem with this is that
every time I sent an email it was from my gmail address <em>not</em> the work
address. Attempts to fix that were futile. I attempted using it as an
<a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=78799">IMAP service</a> but that didn&#8217;t set well and it disabled push. I was stuck
with only able to read them and not reply.</p>

<p>My final solution was to use gmail&#8217;s awesome mobile app. But that was slow and
since I had two gmail accounts (one for work and one for home) it was a pain
to have to log in and out each time. I found this great app called
<a href="http://www.usemailroom.com/">mailroom</a> which fixes all those issues. It is like <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">mailplane</a> for the
iPhone. It basically opens the gmail mobile email app inside and then saves it
to a cache so that it opens fast and with a better interface. It also allows
multiple gmail accounts. Perfect!</p>

<p>My setup is now to have the iPhone mail app set to gmail as an exchange
service. When it recives a push notice that there is new email I notice and
instead of opening up the mail app I open up <a href="http://www.usemailroom.com/">mailroom</a> and manage my email
there. I get the push but also get all the advantages of gmail including
threaded messages, labels, archiving, starring , and more.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did a little hacking in Ruby on Rails using <a href="http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic">formtastic</a> to make an
autocomplete text box. The trouble as of this writing formtastic does not have
an autocomplete input. RoR uses some RJS magic to accomplish autocomplete but I
never like RJS styled AJAX. I prefer unobtrusive JS especially with jQuery.</p>

<p>What I did was create a custom input for formtastic that did nothing but adds a
HTML class name to the input field. Then I had the jQuery turn these to
autocomplete. However to get the values of the autocomplete I also created a
seperate action that returns a <strong>map</strong> to the correct path to the AJAX action.
I don&#8217;t like how complicated that sounds. Maybe some code snippits?</p>

<p>First lets set up the formtastic input (place this in the <code>lib</code> directory):</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/590498.js?file=application_formtastic_builder.rb"> </script>


<p>Now in the view I can setup the form:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/590498.js?file=model_view.html.erb"> </script>


<p>This will allow jQuery to find the text field. However jQuery needs to ask the
application where to look for the autocomplete data. We will create a route to
a custom action and it will tell jQuery where to look. First the routes file:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/590498.js?file=routes.rb"> </script>


<p>Now the contgroller that includes the mapping and the data (this could be done
through more than one controller):</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/590498.js?file=main_controller.rb"> </script>


<p>And finally the javascript to make it all happen:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/590498.js?file=application.js"> </script>


<p>I also include the jQuery js request problem. Take a look at this
<a href="http://www.justinball.com/2010/08/09/jquery-ajax-requests-are-html-not-js/">blog post</a> for some good information concerning jQuery AJAX and Rails.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you like the new site design?</p>

<p>Not much to say since this is a visual thing but the menu to the left is
collapsible. (I love jQuery)</p>

<p>Oh I should mention I developed a JavaScript port of the clasic <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/ski/">ski game</a>
and it is an easter egg here using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">konami code</a>. try it out and have
fun. And check out the code if you want to play with it at

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this great <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/85-yaml-configuration-file">RailsCast</a> about making a global configuration. However
I wanted to further customize it by allowing global configurations regardless
of the environment.</p>

<p>For example this is the original idea:</p>

<pre><code># config/config.yml
development:
  perform_authentication: false

test:
  perform_authentication: false

production:
  perform_authentication: true
  username: admin
  password: secret
</code></pre>

<p>This would require that there be a lot of repetition. What I wanted was a way
to write a global variable once and still keep differences for the
environments. I eventually thought of this solution to manipulate the hash
after the fact (avoiding the warnings that a constant variable being changed).</p>

<p>Instead I want to make it more like:</p>

<pre><code>global_var1: "foo"
global_var2: "bar"
environments:
  development:
    env_var: "foobar"
  test:
    env_var: "barfoo"
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce the following config when <code>RAILS_ENV</code> is development:</p>

<pre><code>APP_CONFIG['global_var1']    #=&gt; "foo"
APP_CONFIG['global_var2']    #=&gt; "bar"
APP_CONFIG['env_var']        #=&gt; "foobar"
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/510438.js?file=load_config.rb"></script>


<p>In a rails application you can put <code>load_config.rb</code> into <code>config/initializers</code>
directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started using <a href="http://irssi.org/">irssi</a> for chatting in IRC recently. One of the
interesting ideas is that I can SSH into a shell use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%20Screen">GNU screen</a> and run
my irssi client without having to <a href="http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi">logout when I move computers</a> Great
solution except on problem.</p>

<p>When someone PM you or mentions you in a channel I like to get a
notification. On my Mac I used to run irssi locally which meant I could use
plugin to send the notification to growl via <a href="http://growl.info/documentation/growlnotify.php">growlnotify</a>. However you
can&#8217;t run this remotely when your using irssi inside an SSH session. Using a
remote SSH session also removed the ability for an irssi plugin to open a link
in your local browser.</p>

<p>Luckily I stumbled across this <a href="http://thorstenl.blogspot.com/2007/01/thls-irssi-notification-script.html">great idea</a> that uses a second SSH session
to <code>tail -f</code> a file that is appended to by the irssi plugin. It essentially
sends the notification back through by the second SSH session monitoring the
file.</p>

<p>I made a slight adjustment to allow URL posting and integrated growlnotify.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.leemhuis.info/files/fnotify/fnotify">fnotify</a> script on the SSH server and install it into irssi
like you would any other plugin. Then on your client (in this case I&#8217;m using
Max OS X with growl installed) and create this script:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/478301.js">  </script>


<p>Then I also add the <a href="http://scripts.irssi.org/html/urlplot.pl.html">urlplot</a> (<a href="http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/urlplot.pl">download</a>) script to irssi and set it&#8217;s
command to post the url to the fnotify log:</p>

<pre><code>/set url_command "echo \"RequestURLBrowse __URL__\" &gt;&gt; ~/.irssi/fnotify"
</code></pre>

<p>This script will post the growl notification for any highlights I get in irssi
and if it&#8217;s a url it will open it in my browser.</p>
