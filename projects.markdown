Projects
--------

These are some of the projects I am working on or have worked on.

#### My GitHub Repositories

- [xmledit](http://github.com/sukima/xmledit) - A filetype plugin for VIM to
  help edit XML files
- [vim-markdown](http://github.com/sukima/vim-markdown) - _(Forked)_ Markdown Vim
  Mode (Incude missing pre block) (Add jekyll YAML support)
- [skiQuery](http://sukima.github.com/skiQuery/) - A JavaScript port of the old
  classic command-line game ski.
- [SimNotify](http://sukima.github.com/SimNotify/) - A Ruby on Rails scheduling
  program for medical simulation centers. This app is very site specific for a
  simulation center that I work for. This project is my attempt to allow people
  to schedule a simulation by entering in key data needed and the
  administrators can place that scheduled session on a calendar.
- [Equipment Status Viewer](http://sukima.github.com/redmine_equipment_status_viewer) -
  A [redmine](http:/www.redmine.org/) plugin that tracks equipment and there
  last know location. Entry of the last know location will be done via an
  iPhone web interface and use qr-codes to "check-out" equipment.
