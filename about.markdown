About Me
--------

TriTarget.org is a name I came up with in high school. I was big into computer
programming and wanted a company name that was kinda catchy. When I made a few
programs in [BASIC][] I would brand them with __TriTarget__ as a way to show
my company (Even though I didn't have one).

_More to come_
