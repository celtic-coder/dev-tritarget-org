Is it possible to have a [markdown][] editor on an [iPad][] or [iPhone][]?

This idea came to me on the basis that there are times when a full laptop is
overkill for a quick blog entry and yet my blogs are done in [Jekyll][] which
is text based not _word Processor_ based.

[iPad]:
[iPhone]:
[Jekyll]:
