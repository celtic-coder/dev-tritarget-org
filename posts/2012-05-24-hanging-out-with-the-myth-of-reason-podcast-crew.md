Yesterday I got the opportunity to go to the recording of the
[Myth of Reason][1] podcast with my friend [Sean Tyler][2] and his
co-conspirator [Shane McKenzie][3], both on air personalities with
[102.3FM The Wolf][4].

We were at [Oak Tree Wine & Spirits][5] recording a segment about the
homebrew beer (Western Pale Ale) Sean and I made.
