Today I got a chance to look around the camp grounds. They had a bunch of
farm animals. From chickens to ducks to donkeys.

The rest of the bunch stayed and worked on their relaxing projects.

The main feature (if you don't count the
_I-can't-believe-I'm-in-the-woods_ campsite) is the covered bridge which
separates the campgrounds with the hiking trails.

The one hiking trail I took was to a 20 foot waterfall which of course I
made a panorama of it. The interesting part is I had to hop rocks over the
creek and then I had to wade though it again to get to this waterfall. It
was fun but defiantly a bit of a hike (for me anyway).
