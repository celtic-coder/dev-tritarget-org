So I took a small road trip to Providence Rhode Island. Where I found the
[South Main Street Park][1] and a War Veterans Memorial.

<!-- more -->

This panoramic was taken using a plumb-bob (explained in [this tutorial][1]).
Because I did not use a tripod I got a lot of [paraallax][2] issues. You can
see them when you look down.

I also took a few other neat photos.
