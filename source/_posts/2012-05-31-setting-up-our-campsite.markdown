Our camping experience had no Internet. So all the gritty details will be
posted over the days following the vacation.

Our first day camping! Well, it was a bit interesting to say the least.
The campsite lays between two motor-homes and the ground was very rocky.
But the good news is that was just the _first_ site. The real site was
another 50 yards into the woods. Passing over a little wooden bridge and
out to the bank of the river.
