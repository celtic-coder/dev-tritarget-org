So my friend and I were out in the back yard taking photos. I tried to do a
quick panorama experiment.

I messed up taking the photos because I didn't take the time to see all the
things that I was shooting. Like the sun which offered a lot of lens flare.
Also the tripod shadow really messed with me. So I was stuck having to crop the
final result which is why there are black circles above and below.

But then again it isn't so bad.
