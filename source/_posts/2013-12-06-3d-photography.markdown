I've been getting into some 3D projects. These are images created and rendered
entirely on a computer using [Blender 3D 2.68][blender]. I started this project
in the intent to build objects for [SecondLife][]. Here is my gallery of images
I've made so far:

My first project was to build a Snow Globe inside [Secondlife][]. Then I tried
making my own in [Blender 3D][blender] by making a stack of books, I rendered
four different style each with a different level of detail. I moved on to
modeling from a picture so I created an image for my work which included an
internal logo / mascot. Finally I too a [YouTube tutorial][1] and created a
impressive water simulation.
