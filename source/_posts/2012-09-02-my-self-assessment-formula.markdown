I've read a lot of self help books. Some about becoming aware. Some about feeling good. Some about communication. They all had the same underlining themes.

* You are the only one responsible for how you feel.
* Strife comes from needs not being met.
* You have to break down a goal into **actionable** steps to move forward.
* **Communication** which includes listening and compromise. And compromise means "I can live with that."

The trouble is (as it usually is) implementation. I thought if I could breakdown the self introspection portion of being aware into simple steps it might be easier to move towards ones goals.

I feel that perhaps I could take some of the techniques I've read about and break them down into bite sized chunks that everyone can run through. I developed a five step Q&A that can help someone discover and plan how to move forward and leave the bad feelings behind.

The basic goal here is to establish an introspective tool that will hopefully identify specific steps someone can do to allow themselves to *feel better*.

So when you or someone you know finds themselves in a negative emotion where they are reacting and not communicating ask the. The following questions. 

For me I was thinking of taking these five questions and making a worksheet or bureaucratic form they must fill out prior to continuing the conversation. But first you have to understand the details of each question.

## What are you feeling right now?
This is important to orient the person to the *bigger picture*. What that means is you need a starting point. It is often the case that in the middle of a situation people don't recognize how they feel. That's not a fault but a survival instinct. When our [limbic system][limbic] kicks in it takes over a good chunk of your brain. This often times is referred to as the *[reptile brain][reptile]* in cases of fight or flight.

The easy way to put this is simple: *people loose their heads* in highly emotional situations. So taking the opportunity here to assess how your feeling will offer insight on what you can do about it.

## What brought you to feel this way?
It is also the case that what you *think* your emotion is about **is not** what it really is. Often people develop an emotion based on another emotion. A profound illustration of this is someone yelling at you for an insult. It is true that they are *angry* at you but the core emotion that spawned the anger is the *insecurity* and/or *injustice* that was triggered by the insult.

In the case above one can't treat the anger without first treating the insecurity. And most cases the entire house of emotional cards can fall down by the very act of recognizing and forgiving yourself for that underlying emotion.

Analyzing the process that brought you to this emotional state can reveal the underlying raw emotions that you can address for lasting and more fulfilling results then just *dealing* with the outward symptomatic emotions and behaviors.

## What does feeling good look like?
In order to make a fulfilling and satisfying change you have to identify how it can be better.

The typical "I want more money" is a good example because ultimately money is a tool to get to where you want to be. In other words you usually don't just collect money (some do) but you want the things that money can afford you. Another example is success. How do you know your successful?

By clearly defining what the outcome looks like you can better establish a framework for which to work with. If you just say "I'll know when I'm successful when I feel as such" you have no basis for comparison and therefore you will likely continue in circles. But if you say "success looks like driving a new car" you now have a clear goal to work with and you will know your successful once you have acquired that car.

This also helps others. If they are relying on you to announce when a situation has been resolved then they will feel helpless or captive to your emotions. And since they do not have direct control of *your* emotions others can develop resentment. However if you offer a clear idea on what feeling good looks like they have the tools to be able to do something about it.

For example say if someone calls you purple and that is offensive instead of saying that hurt my feelings to which the other person is now in a position or guessing what word is better. You could say that calling you orange would make you happier. It takes the guess work out of the game.

## Does this goal conflict with established rules?
This is for those situations when what you want and what others expect don't jibe. It is true that in a structure society you have rules. And it is up to each individual to come to terms with those rules.

This question is a self reflection to identify if your feeling on the matter are worth the fight. Pick your battles. Yes maybe the dishes are not a fun thing to do. But it's a rule and therefore you will require finding a way to cope.

This isn't to say the feelings are invalid. It is still good to analyze with self assessment tools. However if this is a rule then the change has to come within. Maybe in a "I'll get it done and over with" or perhaps help identify ways to better compromise. 

## What action can you do next to move towards your goal?
This is the best part. Learning to move the train along. So 

If you define *abstract* goals then you have stalled yourself from reaching those goals. For example if you say you want a new bike you just can't wake up with one. You have a lot of steps in the way. So a todo item of "get bike" is a little off. Instead break it into smaller chunks.

1. Find bike dealer for price
2. Save up cash

Some people refer to those tangible goals as **next actions** because making the effort to identify specific and obtainable actions or tasks you can do will move you towards the goal.

[Elizabeth Bezant][1] offers a fantastic analogy to this idea using our favorite past time *shopping*. She offers the idea that under pressure making time to clearly define your *shopping list* will result in less stress and higher productivity.

{% blockquote Elizabeth Bezant http://www.writing-information-and-tips.com/goal-setting-is-like-going-shopping.html Goal Setting Is Like Going Shopping %}
So what makes [defining next actions] different from [abstract goals]? A plan. Time was spent deciding what the ideal outcome [is] [...], a list [is] made of the items needed to make that outcome possible [...] and finally the list [is] on hand to be referred to.
{% endblockquote %}

Identifying tangible steps towards your goal will actually make that goal realized. In the context of this self assessment this could be things like:

* discuss my feelings with the person
* take a walk to calm down
* tell someone what I want so they know what I'm looking for
* ask for help

I hope this tool can help others practice a level of [metacognition][2] that was once more reaction then planning.
