I have been doing a lot of study into [CoffeeScript][] and found the ease of class definitions fantastic. But As most of my code used [static classes][1] (methods) I had a bit of trouble figuring out howe it is done in CoffeScript.

I found [this article][2] in the docs that explained most of it. And so I developed an example on [JsFiddle][3]:

{% jsfiddle mjNLv js,result %}
