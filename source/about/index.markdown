TriTarget.org is a name I came up with in high school. I was big into computer
programming and wanted a company name that was kinda catchy. When I made a few
programs in [BASIC][] I would brand them with __TriTarget__ as a way to show
my company (Even though I didn't have one).

After high school I began college as a computer scientist. Part way through I
scored a job as a computer programmer and continued that path for about 6
years. During the dot com burst I was laid off and left to fend in a world were
software development was not a valued commodity anymore (too many fish in the
sea). I began work as an electrician for about 3 years while I trained to be an
[EMT][]. I began that career in the medical field where I eventually became a
Paramedic. I finished my associates degree and after 10 years in the medical
field I found a job at a top hospital as a medical simulation technician.

I am currently managing the technical department for our simulation center and
am in school to complete my bachelors in science with a major in information
systems. My goal is to develop the skills to design and develop software for
the medical community based on good human user interface design.

## What is Medical Simulation?
Medical simulation is a term I use to describe what I do. The premise is the
doctors and nurses and students will enter a scenario or classroom with a high
fidelity manikin that is capable of simulating many form of medical cases. I
run that equipment. A clinician will describe what they want from a clinical
and educational perspective and I translate that into a simulated scenario.

For example say we want a scenario where a patient suddenly develops a cardiac
arrest while a nurse is talking to them what I do is turn the monitor that
reading the patients heart into the arrest. Stop the manikin from breathing,
and provide the equipment and environment so the nurse can then begin CPR.

Goals range anywhere from the clinical skills used to more critical thinking
like remembering to call for help or how to communicate effectively in a scene.
These simulations run the gambit of situations from giving birth to [ECMO][]
simulations to elderly care to simply how to have good bedside manners.

In my current position I run the jack-of-all-trades game where I will be
responsible for ordering new parts, Fixing the mechanics, installing new system
software, developing procedures equipment use, software backups, etc. Teaching
users to run the simulators, programming scheduling and issue tracking
software, room construction, make-up skills to make the simulators more
realistic, Acting in the scenarios, and sometime running the simulations from a
clinical perspective and teaching the students some of the knowledge I have as
a paramedic. I am hoping soon this position will develop into management of a
few technicians just like me.
