## About Me
TriTarget.org is a name I came up with in high school. I was big into computer
programming and wanted a company name that was kinda catchy. When I made a few
programs in [BASIC][] I would brand them with __TriTarget__ as a way to show
my company (Even though I didn't have one).

After high school I began college as a computer scientist. Part way through I
scored a job as a computer programmer and continued that path for about 6
years. During the dot com burst I was laid off and left to fend in a world were
software development was not a valued commodity anymore (too many fish in the
sea). I began work as an electrician for about 3 years while I trained to be an
[EMT][]. I began that career in the medical field where I eventually became a
Paramedic. I finished my associates degree and after 10 years in the medical
field I found a job at a top hospital as a
[medical simulation technician](https://gist.github.com/sukima/5328751).

I developed my technical as well as my software development skills. Becoming a
active member in the development community, I studied modern web and mobile
technologies such as [JavaScript][JS], [Ruby on Rails][RoR], and iPhone
development. I now work in this field and am excited to continue my childhood
dreams of creating great software for everyone to enhance their lives with.
