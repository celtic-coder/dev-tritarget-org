Here are some ideas I plan on working on or have been put on the back burner.
Feel free to contact me if you wish to collaborate.

- **FindAnchorLink** - A chrome extention to find an DOM element's id tag and
  construct a URL with the hash for that id. A simple way to create links to
  sections of a page when no way was provided by the author of the page but the
  header still has an id associated to it.
- **CryptoPage** - A JavaScript library and HTML template to store content
  encrypted and allow the viewer to decrypt the page on load using the correct
  password.
- **[JSAuthentication][1]** - A JavaScript libary and server process to establish a
  secure authentication and possible transport of content. Uses a speciffic
  hashing scheme to accomplish this. [Read more][1]
- **InventoryTracking** - A project that will track inventory based on scanned
  barcodes. Web app for management and reporting. Mobile apps to scanand record
  changes to the inventory quantity.
- A pomodoro chrom extention. A start on
  [github](https://github.com/sukima/omnibox-timer).
