These are some of the projects I am working on or have worked on.

- **[Equipment Status Viewer](http://sukima.github.com/redmine_equipment_status_viewer)** -
  A [redmine][] plugin that tracks equipment and there last know location.
  Entry of the last know location will be done via an iPhone web interface and
  use qr-codes to "check-in" equipment.
- **[skiQuery](http://sukima.github.com/skiQuery/)** - A JavaScript port of the old
  classic command-line game ski.
- **[bjurl](http://sukima.github.com/bjurl)** - A [PERL][] plugin for [irssi][]
  that collects URLs from a channel and dynamically updates a JavaScript based
  website for easy opening in a remote browser. Includes WebKit Desktop
  Notifications and [jQuery][] AJAX Support.
- **[xmledit](http://github.com/sukima/xmledit)** - A filetype plugin for [VIM][]
  to help edit XML files. (I deprecated this for [ZenCodeing][zen] but still
  maintain it for bugs).
- **[vim-markdown](http://github.com/sukima/vim-markdown)** - _(Forked)_ Markdown Vim
  Mode (Incude missing pre block) (Add [jekyll][] YAML support)
- **[SimNotify](http://sukima.github.com/SimNotify/)** - A Ruby on Rails
  scheduling program for medical simulation centers. This app is very site
  specific for a simulation center that I work for. This project is my attempt
  to allow people to schedule a simulation by entering in key data needed and
  the administrators can place that scheduled session on a calendar. (This
  project has been abandoned per management).
