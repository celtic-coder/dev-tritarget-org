  <h3>Not-so-random fortune quote</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    When users see one GUI as beautiful,<br>
    other user interfaces become ugly.<br>
    When users see some programs as winners,<br>
    other programs become lossage.
    </p>
    <p>
    Pointers and NULLs reference each other.<br>
    High level and assembler depend on each other.<br>
    Double and float cast to each other.<br>
    High-endian and low-endian define each other.<br>
    While and until follow each other.
    </p>
    <p>
    Therefore the Guru<br>
    programs without doing anything<br>
    and teaches without saying anything.<br>
    Warnings arise and he lets them come;<br>
    processes are swapped and he lets them go.<br>
    He has but doesn't possess,<br>
    acts but doesn't expect.<br>
    When his work is done, he deletes it.<br>
    That is why it lasts forever.
