These are projects I have worked on or completed that have been out-dated or
abandoned.

- **[xmledit](http://github.com/sukima/xmledit)** - A filetype plugin for [VIM][]
  to help edit XML files. (I deprecated this for [ZenCodeing][zen] but still
  maintain it for bugs).
- **[SimNotify](http://sukima.github.com/SimNotify/)** - A Ruby on Rails
  scheduling program for medical simulation centers. This app is very site
  specific for a simulation center that I work for. This project is my attempt
  to allow people to schedule a simulation by entering in key data needed and
  the administrators can place that scheduled session on a calendar. (This
  project has been abandoned per management).
