I am a mobile application developer. Oh, and I also do web development to. You
see I am a *big* fan of JavaScript. I also love Ruby and am head-over-heals in
love with [CoffeeScript][].

I mainly work on [Titanium][] for the company
[SeeClickFix](http://seeclickfix.com). A company which allows anyone to report
and track non-emergency issues anywhere in the world via the internet. This
empowers citizens, community groups, media organizations and governments to take
care of and improve their neighborhoods.

And BTW this little mobile site was made with [jQuery-mobile][jqm] so
*rockzor*! ðŸ‘ŠðŸ˜Ž
