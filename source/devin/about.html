  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>I am a mobile application developer. Oh, and I also do web development to. You see I am a <em>big</em> fan of JavaScript. I also love Ruby and am head-over-heels for <a href='http://coffeescript.org/'>CoffeeScript</a>.</p>
  <p>I mainly work on <a href='http://www.appcelerator.com/'>Titanium</a> for the company <a href='http://seeclickfix.com'>SeeClickFix</a>. A company which allows anyone to report and track non-emergency issues anywhere in the world via the internet. This empowers citizens, community groups, media organizations and governments to take care of and improve their neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>And BTW this little mobile site was made with <a href='http://jquerymobile.com/'>jQuery-mobile</a> so <em>rockzor</em>! ðŸ‘ŠðŸ˜Ž</p>
